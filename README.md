This project uses Create React App on the frontend and Airtable on the backend;
for more info on using create react app go to the bottom of the readme.

The airtable links can be found here:

Quiz Templates: https://airtable.com/shrB5YfiadVivuuKA

User Responses: https://airtable.com/shrXJfvVK75UcNvfv

For the purpose of simplicity it was assumed all questions would have exactly 5 answers. 

The database has two objects: A quiz template, and a user response. Quiz Templates have a name as well as a field for each question;
User Responses have a field for each response to a question as well as a has one relationship with a quiz template

The frontend has functions for api calls that can be found in sr/utils/api_utils
The main components can be found in src/components
src/App.js was modified to allow for use of react-router-dom for multi page features

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
